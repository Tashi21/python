# python
This is a repository of various small and rudimentary projects I create as part of my jouurney of learning and devloping in Python.

## autograder.py
It runs a given python file and passes any given inputs to it and checks the output against a given output file. It returns True if they match, else False.

## Pong and Snake
Rudimentary games using Python's turtle library. I made them while following Angela Yu's Udemy tutorial, 100 Days of Python. They were made to apply basic OOP concepts like classes and inheritance and also implement some file handling.
