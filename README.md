# Fun With Python
This is a repository of various small and rudimentary projects I create as part of my journey of learning and devloping in Python.

## Autograder
It runs a given python file and passes any given inputs to it and checks the output against a given output file. It returns True if they match, else False.

## Password Manager
A simple Password Manager app created using Python's Tkinter library. It stores passwords and related data in a .json file. It can search for passwords and give appropriate responses depending on if the password is found or not. It also generates random passwords. Currently it stores the raw password, which is insecure. I will implement some form of hashing to it soon.

## Pong and Snake
Rudimentary games using Python's Turtle library. I made them while following Angela Yu's Udemy tutorial, 100 Days of Python. They were made to apply basic OOP concepts like classes and inheritance and also implement some file handling.
